To run any playbook use the following command

$ ansible-playbook <playbook.yml>

To check the playbook for syntax errors

$ ansible-playbook <playbook.yml> --syntax-check

To view hosts list

$ ansible-playbook <playbook.yml> --list-hosts

Example 1: Create the file on the target machines or servers as mentioned in the inventory file and the webserverâ€™s group, save the below code with .yml extension and run the playbook.

- hosts: webservers
  become: true
  tasks:
  - name: Create a file
    file: path=/home/remotehostname/raju.txt state=touch

In the above example, we have used the file module to create the file.


Example 2: Create a directory with the mode as 775 and owner/group as Ansible.

---
- hosts: webservers
  become: true
  tasks:
  - name: Create directory
    file: path=/home/ansible/niranjan state=directory mode=775 owner=ansible group=ansible

Example 3: Create multiple directories. To create multiple directories with one single task you can use the loop with_items statement. So when you run the below playbook it is interpreted as 3 different tasks.

---
- hosts: web-servers
  become: true
  tasks:
  - name: Create multiple directories
    file: path={{item}} state=directory
    with_items:
     - '/home/ansnode-1/vn1'
     - '/home/ansnode-1/vn2'
     - '/home/ansnode-1/vn3'
