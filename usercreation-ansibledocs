You can't put a plaintext password into Ansible. Instead you need to generate one!

The easiest way to do this is with the mkpasswd command:

mkpasswd --method=sha-512

This will prompt you for the plaintext password and will give you a hashed password string you can paste into the task definition

Here for For password secret, I get hash $6$F4NWXRFtSdCi8$DsB5vvMJYusQhSbvGXrYDXL6Xj37MUuqFCd4dGXdKd6NyxT3lpdELN07/Kpo7EjjWnm9zusFg/LLFv6oc.ynu/

So need to copy this hashed password into playbook.So it will look like 

---
- hosts: web-servers
  become: yes
  become_method: sudo
  gather_facts: no
  tasks:
   - name: Add user "test" to remote server
     user:
       name: test
       groups: sudo
       shell: /bin/bash
       state: present
       createhome: yes
       system: no
       password: '$6$nMkxi3ozzhikLI$keJLSEBhIe.Z00CIm/bsuX9ZCuS9bHE2kddq8bdewffMsa3AmyHDx0AQjdtlJZ6yuk9qBHyjfgWCsDIaDREXO0'


Installing mkpasswd

To get the mkpasswd command:

    On Debian/Ubuntu systems, mkpasswd likely exists, but if not, it's part of the whois package: sudo apt-get install -y whois.
